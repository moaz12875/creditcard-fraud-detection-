"Credit Card Fraud Detection using XGBoost with Gradio interface. This project trains a machine learning model on transaction data to identify fraudulent activity. Features preprocessing, probability visualization, custom CSS UI, and real-time prediction demo for fraud risk detection."
ðŸš¨ Credit Card Fraud Detection ðŸ’³
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using XGBoost and other machine learning models. The final app is deployed with a Gradio interface for real-time fraud risk prediction, supported by a custom CSS design and interactive probability visualization.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset used is the[Credit Card Fraud Deetection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/data) 
from Kaggle.

Contains 284,807 transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013.

Each transaction is labeled as:

0 â†’ Legitimate

1 â†’ Fraudulent

## ðŸ¤– Model Comparison  

We experimented with several models to identify the best fraud detection approach.


| Model                  | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|-------------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Logistic Regression     | 94%      | 0.72      | 0.62   | 0.67     |
| K-Nearest Neighbors     | 95%      | 0.75      | 0.64   | 0.69     |
| Decision Tree           | 91%      | 0.68      | 0.61   | 0.64     |
| Random Forest           | 97%      | 0.83      | 0.74   | 0.78     |
| **XGBoost (final)**     | **99%**  | **0.92**  | **0.88** | **0.90** |

âœ… XGBoost was selected as the final model due to its superior performance
